# Cart-Pole
Design and analyses of control systems + kalman filter for a cart pole system. Final project for RBE 502 - Robot Control at WPI.

Project Overview:
  * Modeled and analyzed linear and nonlinear system dynamics of cart-pole system
  * Used a custom MATLAB function to solve closed loop reponse of cart-pole system
  * Implemented multiple Linear Quadratic Regulators as well as a 2 stage PD controller
  * Included process and sensor noisie that required the use of a Kalman Filter for trustworhy state estimation
  * Ran Monte-Carlo evaluations of each controller to compare and contrast performance across 6 different metrics
